Building Alerts and ActionSheets had never been so easy!

## Features

## Installation
EasyAction is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "EasyActionBuilder"
```

## Usage

``` Swift
import EasyActionBuilder
```

### Alert
``` Swift
AlertBuilder(title: "Hello", message: "This is your first action")
    .addAction("OK")
    .show()
```

### Action Sheet
``` Swift
ActionSheetBuilder(title: "", message: "Choose a color")
    .addAction("Red")
    .addAction("Green")
    .addAction("Blue")
    .addAction("Close", style: .cancel)
    .show()
```

## Detailed Usage

### Action Handlers

``` Swift
AlertBuilder(title: "Location", message: "This app needs your permission to use your location")
    .addAction("Allow When using the App", {
        // Handle when using app here
    })
    .addAction("Allow Always", {
        // Handle Always use here
    })
    .addAction("Cancel", style: .cancel)
    .show()
```

### AddingÂ Textfield
``` Swift
AlertBuilder(title: "Password", message: "Enter your Password")
    .addTextField({ (textField) in
        // 1 - Customize your textField in this block
        textField.isSecureTextEntry = true
    })
    .addAction("Login", {
        // 2 - Handle login in this block
    }, textFieldHandler: { (textFields) in
        guard let password: String = textFields?.first?.text else { return }
        // 3 - Validate password in this block
    })
    .addAction("Cancel", style: .cancel)
    .show()

// NOTE: You can only use addTextField method with AlertBuilder
//       With ActionSheetBuilder, It won't work.

```

### Detailed Usage of ActionSheetBuilder
``` Swift
ActionSheetBuilder(title: "Select", message: "Select your favorite singer")
    // 1 - Add Actions
    .addAction("Frank Sinatra", {
        // handle action
    })
    .addAction("Phil Collins", {
        // handle action
    })
    .addAction("Freddie Mercury", {
        // handle action
    })
    // 2 - Set tint color
    .setTintColor(.black)
    .show()
```

### iPad Configurations for ActionSheet

When you want to present your ActionSheet on iPad, the ActionSheet needs to know where It is presenting from. This can be achieved by using `setBarButtonItem` or `setPresentingSource` methods. The app will never crashes if you don't use them. Also you may want to use `show(in: Position)` method. 


``` Swift
ActionSheetBuilder(title: "Add", message: "Add Alarm")
    .addAction("Today")
    .addAction("31 March 2019")
    // Set the presenting source of ActionSheet to navigationBarItem
    .setBarButtonItem(navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem!)
    .show()
```

``` Swift
ActionSheetBuilder(title: "Pop-Up", message: "")
    .addAction("Action 1 ")
    .addAction("Action 2")
    // Set the presenting source of ActionSheet to a UIButton
    .setPresentingSource(myFancyButton)
    .show()
```

``` Swift
ActionSheetBuilder(title: "Picker", message: "Pick something")
    .addAction("1")
    .addAction("2")
    // Shows the ActionSheet at the bottom-center of iPad
    .show(in: .bottom)
```
